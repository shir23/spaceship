    <p>A space suit is a <a href = "https://www.safeopedia.com/definition/973/protective-clothing">protective
        garment</a> that prevents an astronaut from dying horribly when they step into airless space.
        Also known as atmosphere suit, vac suit, pressure suit, space armor, environment(al) suit, 
        e-suit, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity">EVA suit.</a>

    <p>Current NASA suits look like baggy inflated coveralls with a large back pack and a spherical fishbowl over the head. 
        Often in old illustrations there are accordion bellows at the joints.
    NASA astronaut always put on a transdermal dimenhydrinate anti-nausea patch when suiting up in a space suit, in case of drop sickness. 
    The chances of that are slight, but suffocating inside a helmet full of vomit is a nasty way to die.
